                     **FREE RESEARCH LICENSE**

This License Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between the Author (referred to as the "Licensor") and any individual, entity, or organization (referred to as the "Licensee") wishing to use the software created by the Licensor (the "Software"). By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software, the Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

              **1. Grant of License**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software for academic, personal, or research use, on the condition that any results, products, software, reports, or other materials created as a result of the Software's use must also be made freely available to others.

              **2. Limitation of Liability**

The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. The Licensor shall not be liable for any damages, including but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Software, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

              **3. Commercial Use**

a. The Licensee may use the Software for commercial purposes, provided that:

   i. The solution, service, product or report developed using the Software is also made available as free and open source under a license compatible with this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of the Software by third-party monitoring solutions.

b. Commercial use that does not meet the above requirements is strictly prohibited. That said, the Licensee states that it agrees that such use may, depending on each case, generate a fine on its part in favor of the Licensor.

c. Any individual, organization or entity may contact Licensor requesting a less restrictive and commercially viable license. The request does not imply immediate approval, requiring a response from the Licensor explicitly defining a new license for the use in question.

              **4. Redistributions**

The Licensee may redistribute the Software, either in its original form, provided that any redistribution includes a copy of this Agreement.

              **5. Termination**

This License Agreement is effective until terminated. The Licensor may terminate the Licensee's rights under this Agreement immediately and without notice if the Licensee breaches any of its provisions. Upon termination, the Licensee must cease using and distributing the Software.


              **6. Entire Agreement**

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Licensor and the Licensee regarding the Software and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether oral or written.

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software, the Licensee acknowledges that they have read and understood this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.
